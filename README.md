# Sylvach Kinetic Tracker: 2D Map

**Focus:** Low-Resource Federated Learning, Decentralized Systems, Fixed-Point Dynamics

---

## Overview
**Sylvach Kinetic Tracker** is a **real-time visualization tool** for analyzing **fixed-point contraction dynamics** in large-scale decentralized systems. It simulates **1,000 nodes** in a 2D phase-space, tracking:
- **Contraction velocity** (how quickly nodes converge).
- **Phase coherence** (alignment toward the fixed point).
- **Stability tension** (distribution of nodes).
- **SHA-256 state delta** (cryptographic fingerprint of system state).

**Designed for:** Federated learning (FL) and decentralized optimization, with a focus on **low-resource, large-scale networks**

## Key Features
### 1. **Fixed-Point Contraction Mapping**
- Uses **Banach fixed-point theorem** to model node convergence.
- Configurable **over-relaxation factor** (\(\alpha = 1.12\)) and **contraction constant** (\(k = 0.88\)).

### 2. **2D Phase-Space Visualization**
- **Contour map** of the potential field.
- **Node swarm** with heatmap coloring (proximity to attractor).
- **Fixed-point marker** (red cross) for the global attractor.

### 3. **Dynamic Telemetry HUD**
- **4 Metrics Panels**:
  - **Contraction Velocity**: Speed of node convergence.
  - **Phase Coherence**: Alignment of node movement toward the fixed point.
  - **Stability Tension**: Standard deviation of node distribution.
  - **SHA-256 State Delta**: Cryptographic fingerprint of system state.

### 4. **Low-Resource Design**
- Optimized for **communication, memory, and energy efficiency**.
- Aligns with your research on **dismantling the "compute wall"** in FL.

### 5. **Production-Ready**
- Smooth animation, fixed scaling, and clean visuals.
- Configurable parameters for adaptability.
